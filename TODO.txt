		    (in a vague, mostly vibe-based order)



~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
||=====================================||
||< CATEGORY A: ADVANCED BEAMSTACKING >||
||=====================================||
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-Make Charge Beam function
	-This entails:
		* Charge shots
		* The charge lead
		* Alternate ways to fire the arm cannon ("CustomFires")
		* the Primary quick-swap
		* array passives (boosts that still apply while in the array)
		* Multiple CustomFires at once?
		* [eventually] Charge Combos

-Make Wave Beam
	-This entails:
		* Projectile behavior injection
		* Multiple beam shots in one firing (charge shot increases projectile count to 2 if it wasn't at or past it already)
		* Special behavior on charge shots
		* Tile interaction (similar principles can be applied to entity interaction)

-Make Hyper Beam
	-Why now? Because it entails:
		* VIB addon behavior
		* Item VFX
		* Advanced beam graphical effects
		* Suitlocking

-Implement primary array
	-Add array UI to the UI
	-Implement radial menu
		-Concept: Pressing the interface button opens a wheel around the player containing the currently-selected mode's quick-swap array.
			Not used to add or remove beams from the array, simply to swap what's equipped

-Beam special textures (fusion DNA beam)
	-Method in the beamshot, check shapewinner's specialtexture method against the rest of the array
	-method returns the new shot and charge shot textures and sounds

-Beam texture animation
	-Variable for counting the texture's frames already exists but does not currently get used

-Arm cannon beam lights
	-Classic design: Simple glowmask colored to match the current ColorPriority. Think MercurySteam arm cannons.
	-Prime design: Arm Cannon's shape is decided by ShapePriority, with the color of the exposed lighty-bits determined by ColorPriority. (e.g. plasma's extra length w/ Ice blue)

-Make sure system is multiplayer compatible

-Localization Antics
	-Give beam addons fancy tooltips
	-Make beam shot's localization name change to match addons equipped
		-Override DisplayName with the ShapePriority?
			-Append first word of ColorPriority to the beginning? (e.g. Wave Spazer Beam, Ice Plasma Beam)

-Make better UI
	-Current UI is 99% placeholder, but the AddonSlot system in ArmCannonUI is pretty much complete.
	-Would like to keep all of the slot menus in the same UI file if possible (save the radials obviously)

-Make example beam addon in the example submod
	-Move Test Beam there after everything else is good to go?


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~





~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
||==============================||
||< CATEGORY B: MISSILE SYSTEM >||
||==============================||
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
-Decide whether or not missile addons should have their own dedicated projectiles
	-Points in favor of having dedicated projectiles:
		* Able to copy 80% of charge combo code verbatim
		* Only one missile slot actually changes the properties of the standard shot
		* More intuitive, in the sense that missiles are a lot more physical than beams
	-Points against having dedicated projectiles:
		* Makes it much more difficult to create a missile addon
		* Creates a dissonance between weapon addon systems
		* The third point in favor of dedicated projectiles is total conjecture

-Determine how to port charge combos
	-See if making beam-related ones require that beam equipped breaks balancing or not

-Make a config to change starting missiles to 0 and let missile expansions stack 1 higher
	-Useful for mapmaking


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~





~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
||=======================================||
||< CATEGORY C: UPGRADES TO OLD SYSTEMS >||
||=======================================||
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-Figure out shaders for better beam coloring
	-Texture coloring functions, but looks like ass.
	-Could possibly use armor shaders? (Critter Shampoo applies armor dye to projectiles (minions, namely (yeah apparently they're projectiles, I didn't realize either)))

-Add automatic texture-grabbing for suit addons
	-Very easy to implement, but tedious; requires renaming all suitaddon assets to match format

-Upgrade DustyDeath to be more like the copy inside of BeamShot
	-I ended up making the dusty death in the beamshot more complicated as a natural part of development and it only makes sense to bring MProjectile up to the same standard

-Figure out how to fix the thing where gravity uses neptune's shell physics underwater and not normal physics
	-Honestly this one is kind of a tangent. I saw it mentioned in an old conversation while looking for something or other.


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~





~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
||=====================||
||< CATEGORY D: FIXES >||
||=====================||
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-Re-add old beam/missile VFX that died in the port
	- Dust trails on beams, death dust particles might be too small
	- Ice Beam's roation effect while it has shapepriority

-Add failsafes for missing beam addon assets
	-VERY IMPORTANT. Especially since I doubt everyone wants a custom impact SE on their beam, but I also don't want to take away from the automaticness

-Fix all the systems I broke
	-Worldgen
		-Chozo Statues/OORBs
		-Missile/E-tank placements
	-Fake blocks
	-Parts of suit energy apparently
	-Hatches probably
